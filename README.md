# CSE330 News Sharing Website

A project made for CSE330-CREATIVE PROGRAMMING AND RAPID PROTYPING. Functionality:  

Users can register for accounts and then log in to the website.  

Accounts should have both a username and a secure password. NEVER store plaintext passwords in a database!

Registered users can submit story commentary.

A link can be associated with each story, and they should be stored in a separate database field from the story.

Registered users can comment on any story.

Unregistered users can only view stories and comments.

Registered users can edit and delete their stories and comments.

All data must be kept in a MySQL database (user information, stories, comments, and links).

Creative Portion: For the creative Portion of this project we came up with the ability for the  users to search for posts by others using the username.
